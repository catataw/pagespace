# Publishing

Changes made to pages are not immediately visible to visitors of the website. The page that the changes belong to 
must first be **published**.

Pages with unpublished changes are visible in the sitemap by the presence of the <i>Publish</i> button.

To publish a page:

1. Press a page's <i>Publish</i> button or go to the main <i>Publishing</i> tab.
2. The publishing view lists all the pages which have unpublished changes and therefore may be published.
3. Select one or more page that you wish to publish. Items which are selected to publish appear in green.
4. Press the <i>Publish</i> button to complete the process.
