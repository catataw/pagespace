## Publishing

Changes made to pages are not immediately visible to visitors of your web-site. The page that the changes belong to 
must first be published.

Pages with unpublished changes are visible in the site-map by the presence of the *Publish* button.

To publish a page:

1. Press a page's *Publish* button or select the main *Publishing* tab.
2. The publishing view lists all the pages which may be published.
3. Select one or more page that you wish to publish. Items which are selected to publish appear in green.
4. Press *Publish* to complete the process.
